Softmax Classification (with Cross-Entropy Loss)

Implement a fully-vectorized loss function for the Softmax classifier
Implement the fully-vectorized expression for its analytic gradient
Check your implementation with numerical gradient
Use a validation set to tune the learning rate and regularization strength
Optimize the loss function with SGD
Visualize the final learned weights

2_two_layer_net.ipynb

Develop a neural network with fully-connected layers to perform classification, and test it out on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

3_features.ipynb

Show that we can improve our classification performance by training linear classifiers not on raw pixels but on features that are computed from the raw pixels.
